## Laguerre polynomials - zeros and quadratures
The project focuses on the study of Laguerre polynomials, particularly on determining their zeros and the weights for Gauss-Laguerre quadratures. The aim of the work was to create functions for computing Laguerre polynomials, their derivatives of specified orders, and generating plots of the computed functions. Subsequently, functions were developed to determine the zeros of these polynomials using the Newton-Raphson method. Finally, the application of the obtained results in Gauss-Laguerre quadratures was presented.
